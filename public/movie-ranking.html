<h1>The Best Anime According to Jecson</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Animes of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.
    One Piece follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber after accidentally eating a Devil Fruit, and his
    ragtag crew of pirates, the Straw Hat Pirates. They journey across the Grand Line, a treacherous sea filled with
    islands, mysteries, and powerful enemies, in search of the legendary treasure, "One Piece," and Luffy's dream of
    becoming the King of the Pirates. Along the way, they face the powerful World Government, other pirate crews, and
    encounter a diverse cast of characters, forming strong bonds of friendship and fighting for their dreams and the
    freedom of others. The story is a grand adventure filled with action, humor, heart-wrenching moments, and complex
    world-building."</p>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>Bleach follows the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student with the ability to see ghosts. His life takes a
    dramatic turn when he encounters Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper (a supernatural being who protects humans from evil
    spirits called Hollows). Rukia is injured in a battle with a Hollow and transfers her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo
    so he can defeat it. </p>
<p>
    This act leaves Rukia powerless, and Ichigo is forced to take on the role of a Soul Reaper, battling Hollows and
    guiding lost souls to the Soul Society (the afterlife). As the story progresses, Ichigo gets drawn deeper into the
    world of Soul Reapers, facing powerful enemies and uncovering secrets about the Soul Society and his own past. He
    gains allies among his classmates (who also develop abilities) and within the Soul Society itself.</p>
<h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
<p>In a world where hunters with supernatural abilities battle monsters to protect humanity, Sung Jin-Woo is the weakest
    hunter of all. Constantly risking his life in low-rank dungeons, he's barely scraping by. One day, during a
    particularly dangerous raid, he's left for dead by his fellow hunters. Just as he's about to die, a mysterious
    System chooses him as its Player. This System grants him the ability to level up and become exponentially stronger,
    similar to a character in a video game. Initially, he can only see the System's quests and notifications, but as he
    completes them, he gains experience, improves his stats, and acquires new skills. He starts climbing the ranks,
    hiding his newfound power while navigating the complex world of hunters, guilds, and the looming threat of powerful
    monsters and interdimensional gates. As he grows stronger, he uncovers secrets about the System and the true nature
    of the world, eventually becoming humanity's greatest weapon against the monstrous threats. It's a story of
    incredible power progression, hidden identities, and the fight to protect humanity against overwhelming odds.</p>
